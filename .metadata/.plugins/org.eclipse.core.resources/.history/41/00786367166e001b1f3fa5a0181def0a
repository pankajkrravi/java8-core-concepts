/*
 * This is the start of the challenge on beyond basics. 
 * This program creates a string arraylist and then adds 5 grocery items to 
 * the list.  Then, it prompts the user to enter another item, it searches the 
 * list, if it is not found, it adds it to the list, otherwise it displays
 * a message that the item is already in the list.
